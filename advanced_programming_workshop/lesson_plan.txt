Advanced Programming Workshop
FIRST Robotics team 3710.

We should run the basic workshop first and then see what topics we want to do in the second session. Topics we could do include:

- Review of material from Basic Workshop
- Objects
- Javadoc
    - Look at use of objects in 3710 robot code
    - Look at WPIlib
- while loops / for loops - we don't use them in FIRST, but they're very useful
- arrays
- overview of FISRT sensors
- what the different sensors look like in code.
