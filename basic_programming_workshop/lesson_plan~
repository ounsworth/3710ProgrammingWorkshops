Basic Programming Workshop (presented in Java, but c++ is almost identical for the basics)
FIRST Robotics teams 3710 and 2809, presented by Mike Ounsworth.
This workshop is intended to run 1.5 to 2 hours.

- Basic data types
- Variables
- print statements
- boolean logic
- if statements

- 15 minute break to let them try the excercises

- functions
- comments / good variable names
- FRC Code








Excersises
(when it says 'ask the user' just make a variable called 'userInput' and pretend they typed it in, actually interacting with the user is a little more complicated than I have time to explain)

Create a program to:
Easy:
- convert fahrenheit into celsius. (degF = (9 / 5) * degC + 32)
- Ask the user for a number n, then roll an n-sided die.
     double randomNumber = Math.random();  (will give a number between 0 and 1)
- At the State Fair Pie Eating Contest all contestants in the heavyweight division must weigh within 30 pounds of 250 pounds (220 - 280). Write a program that asks for a contestant's weight and then says if the contestant is allowed in the contest.

Harder:
- Discounts at a store: a jar of peanut butter costs $2.79. Ask the user how many they want to buy and calculate their total. BUT if they buy more than 10 they get a 15% discount, and if they buy more than 20 they get a 25% discount.
- Sorting: take three numbers and print out the smallest number. (A better version of this could do an arbitrary amount of numbers, but would need loops and arrays)

Loops:
- Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1,000 to 10,000. ie 1000 + 1001 + 1002 + ... + 10,000 (hint: it should be 49,505,500)









Aditional 'Advanced' Topics:
- Loops (not really used in FRC)
- Arrays
- Objects
